This project is intended to be a game LMS connector for faculty for a large univeristy. We are running in a ddev env and simulating  shibboleth authentication saved in PHP $_SERVER. The end result is expected to be an easy way for faculty to uplaod games that they have created in gemini ai canvas after being asked to include src/js/library.js which is responsible for sending the score to its parent frame. The idea is that a faculty member would upload their single page app/game from gemini and the student would always play the game within that iframe. There is a fully functioning LTI example currently in index.php. That will need to be modified to contain the frameset. We are using ddev to simulate a shibboleth authentication. The users directory for projects should exist in $_SERVER['cn'].
