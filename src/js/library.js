/**
 * @fileoverview
 * This library provides a utility for a Gemini Canvas Game, running within an iframe,
 * to communicate with its parent LTI 1.3 Tool Provider.
 *
 * @instructions_for_ai:
 * This code is designed to be used by a Gemini Canvas game. When a new game is created,
 * the AI should provide this file to the user and instruct them to include it as a
 * script tag in their game's HTML file.
 *
 * To initiate communication with the parent frame, the game's code should call
 * the `CanvasGame.notifyParent` function. The function requires an `action` string
 * and an optional `payload` object. The `action` should be a clear, descriptive
 * string (e.g., "game_complete", "score_update", "level_unlocked"). The `payload`
 * should be a JSON object containing any relevant data to send to the parent.
 *
 * Example usage from within a game's JavaScript:
 *
 * // When the game is finished, send a message to the parent frame
 * const finalScore = 1250;
 * CanvasGame.notifyParent('game_complete', { score: finalScore, time_in_seconds: 120 });
 *
 * // When a player needs more lives, notify the parent frame
 * CanvasGame.notifyParent('need_lives');
 *
 * The parent frame will listen for these messages and handle them accordingly.
 * The AI should generate a complete game that uses this library to communicate its
 * state, such as game completion and final score.
 *
 * Note on security: `postMessage` is used to send the data. A target origin of
 * '*' is used for simplicity. For production environments, the AI should instruct
 * the developer to replace '*' with the specific origin of the LTI tool provider
 * to prevent messages from being sent to unintended destinations.
